# DEEPLENSE 
This project is a solution for one among the [DEEPLENSE](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2025/proposal_DEEPLENSE1.html) problem of GSoC2025.

## Problem1:  ["Foundation Model for Gravitational Lensing"](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2025/proposal_DEEPLENSE.html):
### Task:
-Task ideas
-Develop a pre-training strategy for learning robust representations of gravitational lensing data.
-Fine-tune the foundation model for multiple tasks such as classification, super-resolution, and regression.
-Evaluate the model’s performance on different astrophysical datasets and benchmark against traditional methods.

### Solution


## Problem2: [Gravitational Lens Finding](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2025/proposal_DEEPLENSE4.html)
### Task ideas
-Start with architectures previously explored within the DeepLense project and optimise them for the lens finding task.
-Perform the lens search in the real observational data and analyse the properties of the detected lens candidates.
-Evaluate model performance on different surveys.

### Solution
